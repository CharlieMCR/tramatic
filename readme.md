## Tramatic

[Tramatic](//tramatic.co.uk) is a slightly useless tram disruption service. Designed for those who don't follow nor have an interest in the major sports events that overcrowd Manchester's tram system regularly.

A project of two halves. Tramatic is designed to be an exercise in building a RESTful API alongside an Angular Front-End.

Albeit still a work in progress, with original intentions to include line status and stop locations and many TODOs.

The core essence of the project is functional. Is someone sportsing up the tram today!
